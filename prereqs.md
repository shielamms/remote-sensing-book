# Pre-requisites

While Iâ€™ve tried my best to make the concepts as accessible as possible to anyone, the following are needed to make the most out of this Jupyter Book:

- Basic Python knowledge and programming skills, as well as the use of Jupyter Notebooks
- Some experience casually tinkering with Google Earth
- Some understanding of the geographic coordinate system (latitude, longitude)
- A firm acceptance of the fact that the earth is not flat ðŸ™‚

The next subsections will get you started with some basic Google Earth Engine concepts and the required environment setup to run the code in your own Jupyter notebook.
