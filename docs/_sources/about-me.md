# About the Author

Shiela is a Data Engineer at [BridgeU](https://bridge-u.com), working with a small data team to build and maintain data processing pipelines and infrastructure, identify data sources and improve team processes around ensuring data quality and technical documentation. One of her recent side-project passions is remote sensing technology and how data from satellites can help us understand geographic features and patterns on earth. The recent successes of NASA projects in space has inspired her to look up at the sky and view the world from a much grander perspective.

Shiela has a Bsc in Computer Science at Saint Louis University, Philippines, and has 8 years of experience working in various areas of computer engineering - from web development, quality assurance, machine learning, cloud infrastructure, and data engineering. After living in the tech metropolis of Tokyo for almost 4 years, she now resides in a reasonably maintained Victorian-style flat in London.
