# Remote Sensing with Google Earth Engine and Python

This Jupyter Book is an introduction to the use of the Google Earth Engineâ€™s Python SDK to visualise and analyse satellite imagery such as those from NASA and the European Space Agency satellites. Each chapter provides code samples to demonstrate how to use the Google Earth Engine API to create and manipulate maps for geospatial analysis. These include simple explanations to the concepts around remote sensing, the satellite image dataset, and/or about the python code.
